# Soulseek Network Research Report

This dashboard presents findings from our distributed monitoring of the Soulseek P2P network across multiple geographic regions.

<!-- stats-grid -->

## Data Collection Overview

Our research infrastructure spans three geographic regions (Germany, US, Singapore), providing diverse visibility into global music search patterns.

<!-- chart: daily_flow -->

The geographic distribution shows interesting regional variations in search volume:

<!-- chart: client_distribution -->

Client convergence analysis reveals how searches are distributed across our monitoring infrastructure:

### Key Observations

- **Geographic diversity** enables comprehensive network coverage
- **Raw data collection** shows actual network load per client
- **Temporal patterns** reveal global music discovery behaviors

## User Activity Trends

Understanding daily active user patterns helps identify engagement levels across the network.
